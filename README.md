# Rwanda Driving License (RDL) Web Application

## Overview

The **Rwanda Driving License (RDL)** is an institution responsible for issuing **Provisional** and **Definitive Driving Licenses**. Located in **Kigali City, Nyarugenge District**, RDL has historically relied on a **paper-based system** to manage candidates' driving license results. This has led to challenges such as:

- Files being lost or damaged.
- Lack of efficient access to candidate data.
- Difficulty tracking and updating records.

To solve this, RDL decided to digitize their system by hiring a web developer to create a **web-based application** that stores and manages candidatesâ€™ information securely and efficiently

```bash
git clone https://github.com/utujeolivier466/Rwanda-driving.git
